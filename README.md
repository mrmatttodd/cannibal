Branch off master for new development. Keep development modular, have a branch per issue (better too many branches then too few).

Once development done on your branch merge into B_CI (Branch for Continuous Intergration). Test thoroughly on CI.

After you're satisfied on CI let other person know how to test changes.

After other person approves merge your branch to the master.

Test thoroughly on master especially if there are merge conflicts.
